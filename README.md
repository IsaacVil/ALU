# Arithmetic Logic Unit (Arithmetic and Boolean components) in Verilog

## About the Project  
This project involves the development of the **Arithmetic and Boolean components** of an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** for a CPU. The ALU, a fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU), is responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations.  
The project was developed collaboratively by a team of four, including myself, as part of our coursework at the **Costa Rican Institute of Technology (TEC)**. Using **Verilog**, we implemented and simulated the ALU with a focus on modularity and functionality.

## Features
- **Arithmetic Operations**:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- **Boolean Operations**:
  - AND
  - OR
  - XOR
  - NOT
- **Control Signals**:
  - Operation selection through encoded control inputs.
  - Status flags for **zero**, **carry**, and **overflow** conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware Description Language**: Verilog  
- **Simulation Tools**: CMD console.  
- **Design Approach**: Modular design with testbenches for each component.  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we:  
- Gained a deeper understanding of **digital logic design** and the architecture of a CPU's ALU.  
- Learned to write, simulate, and verify **hardware designs** using Verilog.  
- Improved our ability to debug and optimize hardware components for performance and accuracy.  
- Developed skills in creating modular hardware systems with reusable and testable components.  
- Enhanced teamwork and collaboration, effectively dividing tasks and integrating our work using version control.
